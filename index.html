      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>
        With a strong current concentration on web development, I am an IT
        Support Specialist known for being "always focused on the client’s
        needs with a genuine desire to provide the best support possible."
      </p>

      <p>
        It has been said that I have “a willingness to go above and beyond,”
        and am one who "consistently provides a high level of service to all
        clients."
      </p>

      <p>
        With years of experience in Desktop/Network, on-site and field service
        technical support, my focus has always been on providing excellent IT
        customer service. Representing the major hardware vendors I have
        provided hardware support servicing laptops, desktops, servers,
        printers and other peripheral and networking equipment, as well as
        software support in Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia.
      </p>
      <p>New opportunities to grow my skills are always of interest to me!</p>
